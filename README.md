CVE-2024-6387 Checker
This README provides instructions for using the script to check if your OpenSSH installation is vulnerable to CVE-2024-6387. The script inspects the installed sshd binaries on your system, determines their versions, and checks for vulnerability status based on the detected version.

Requirements
Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.)
awk, grep, sed, strings, and cut utilities available in your shell environment
Script Overview
The script performs the following steps:

Identifies all instances of sshd using the type -a sshd command.
Extracts the version string from each sshd binary.
Parses the version string to determine the major and minor version numbers.
Checks the parsed version against known vulnerable and non-vulnerable versions of OpenSSH.
Outputs the version and vulnerability status for each sshd binary.
Usage
Copy the script into a file, e.g., check_cve_2024_6387.sh.
